Hello,
I am svs, or Siddharth. For the last 15 years, I have been involved in building digital products distributed over the Internet. I've worked on products both big and small, both purely digital and with a large ops component and I've led teams from three people to more than a 150.

Over the years, I've learned a lot and I share my experience on my blog here -> [The Engineering Org](https://engineeringorg.com)
